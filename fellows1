## Invisible College Goal: design an organization that's maximally efficient and effective at research
We can outcompete academic and industry research, by:
- Using cheaper labor (pay lower salaries)
  - Giving labor more freedom, they'll be happy with less money
- Have lower overhead in costs (no tuition fees)
- Have lower overhead for workers (no required classes/exams/b.s.)
- Have better peer review system (considerit, design it,
  real leadership)
- Have more money available (via company profit)

#### Sampling the current research market:

**Costs Overhead:** Of my $750k NSF grant, only $60-80k (8-10%) went
to my salary, and perhaps 15-20% went to the research if you count
equipment and collaborators.  55% went straight to UW tax.  If I was
given more freedom, I'd work for $1200 instead of $2200-$3000,
reducing costs to about 3% of NSF.

If we start a college campus, we can eliminate housing costs for
fellows, by combining them with the cost of maintaining the campus.
We can run this in a beautiful remote location, to get a cheap cost of
land.

Microsoft research pays employees $100k-300k?  We can pay more like
$10-15k for basic fellowships, with more possible for people who get
upside revenue from companies.

**Effort Overhead:** It took ~2.8 years before we got money from that
grant (it was rejected the first time, so I had to wait a year).  I
spent 2-5 months writing it.

**Funding:** Microsoft's R&D budget is 10x the entire NSF.  If we are
effective, we can get industry money and allocate it to research and
outpace the NSF.  For instance, the Media Lab gets corporate
investment in research by facilitating conversations with researchers
and sponsored demos.

**Peer Review:** CHI papers really suck. They don't build on one
another.  Academics are out of touch with practice.  Your papers must
be reviewed by a few people who might not be your target audience.
CHI has poor leadership.  The worst design firms (Microsoft) dominate
reviews.  We can do better.  We'll demonstrate this by releasing great
work like statebus that changes the world.



## Some Rules for Fellowships: Leaders and followers
- Each project has a leader (or leaders).
- Fellows are paid a stipend (e.g. $800) to (a) help out on
  established invisible college research projects part time and (b) do
  whatever they want in their remaining time.
  - By helping others, you help the college's projects, and get socialized
    into it, and meet people, and they meet you, and you learn from
    them, and they learn from you.
  - Fellows have freedom to choose which projects to work on, and
    discover how they can help the most, which helps them learn their
    strengths.
- If you release a project that people think is cool, you get approved
  to lead projects that fellows are paid to work on.
- Project leaders are in competition to get fellows to work on their projects.
- Projects can make money, and then they can offer wages, and can even
  pay fellows, turning them into employees
