This is just an idea I had in the shower.  It's probably not right,
but it'll be useful to critique it.

## Rules for Fellowships

- Members work on projects
- Each project has a leader(s
- Some members get fellowships, meaning they:
  - Earn a stipend (e.g. $800)
  - Spend some time helping out with others' projects
  - Have full freedom to choose which projects to help with
  - Do whatever they want in their remaining time
- If a member completes a cool project, the college approves them to lead
  projects that other fellows can work on
- Project leaders are in competition to get fellows to work on their projects.
- Projects can make money, and then they can offer wages, and can even
  pay fellows, turning them into employees

By helping others, you help the college's projects, and get socialized
into it, and meet people, and they meet you, and you learn from
them, and they learn from you.

Fellows have freedom to choose which projects to work on, and discover
how they can help the most, which helps them learn their strengths.
