# Morgan's Cheeseburger Points to Explain

__Chat__ with the thinker to complete a __summary__ of what's troubling.
__Refine__ the summary as you go, until the thinker feels that (1) it fully
captures their experience, and (2) it's simple. The goal is to help the thinker 
recognize similar experiences in the future and respond to them differently.

#### Summary: Fill in the boxes
* __Trigger__: An experience that triggers or "cues" the Cheezy Thought.
* __Cheezy Thought__: Troubling and distorted.
* __Effects__: Feelings, behaviors, and outcomes caused by the thought.
* __Alternative Thought__: Leads to better effects than the Cheezy Thought.

#### Chat: Use active listening skills to elicit summary points
* __Restate__: Paraphrase what they said using the summary as a model.
* __Question__: Ask them directly for the summary points.
* __Walkthrough__: Link the summary points together and ask if it's complete.


#### Refine: Improve the summary as you go
* __Rough is good__. The thinker will have insights along the way. Each of
the summary points are interrelated and affect each other, so it's better
to fill them all out roughly than it is to block on one specific point.
* __Keep it simple__. Try to keep few points per summary box. Merge relate
points together as one concept rather than adding multiple points
(but still capture what the thinker said).

Here are the helper's goals, expressed in language analagous to
user-interface design:

# Phase 1: Get a MVP

> Getting a *Minimum-Viable Story" of the thinker's problems.

Do these things first:
- Fill in Trigger, Cheesy Thought, and Effects
- Link each together
- Label a distortion

Then finish phase 1 by filling in an:
- Alternative thought

## Filling in Trigger, Cheesy Thought and Effects.

> Analagous to ["Tasks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_analysis)
> in user interface design, where filling these in ensures that the
> design team has expressed a coverage of the design from the user's
> perspective.  In therapy, filling in the Trigger, Cheesy Thought,
> and Effects ensure coverage of the *story* from the *thinker's*
> perspective.

Criteria for completion:
- **Trigger:** a cue; states an experience that triggers the thought
- **Cheesy Thought:** is both distorted and troubling
- **Effects:** is feelings and behaviors and outcomes

Don't get these perfect yet.

## Distortion

> Analagous to a
> [Heuristic Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation);
> labeling a problematic story (the cheesy thought) with a type of
> distortion is a way to point out a problem in the story (aka *the
> design*) along with a convincing rationale that is easy to
> communicate.

Criteria for completion:
- Label the distortion (which will teach the general theory)
- Explain how it applies

## Test the Links

> [Cognitive Walkthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_walkthrough)

> You will feel enlightened, and confident in your newfound
> understanding for the situation.

Criteria for completion:
- It makes sense to the helper and the thinker

## Then: Alternative Thought

The helper can complete the above items in any order, but only after
completing them should he ask the thinker for an alternative thought.
Perhaps in the UI this box should actually "unlock" like a level in a
video game.

# Phase 2: Iterate until `Complete'

This phase is where you improve the story, optimizing for criteria for
each of trigger, thought, and effects.

The thinker will find parts of the story that aren't quite right, or
can be imprved, and try to improve them.  The helper restates things
and links them together, spurring further creative thoughts for the
thinker, and together they iteratively improve each item until the
thinker feels complete with it and is ready to move on with their
life.

Criteria
-----

More specifically, they will together be making the story more
**memorable** and **meaningful**.  A story will be *meaningful* when
it applies to large aspects of the person's life, and changes it in
strongly positive ways.

- Trigger should become more and more: **memorable**. It should have
good precision and recall over the situations where the thought comes
up.
- Thought should become more and more **troubling** and **distorted**.
- Effects: a **memorable** set of symptoms
- Distortion: should be `_____________________________`?
- Alternative thought: Should be relieving, and **lead to positive
  effects**. Helper can test by asking for how the thought would
  thinker feel and act.

The trigger and effects are cues that should be memorable.  The
thought and alternative thought should be strongly negative, strongly
distorted, and strongly positive.

These should each be memorable because the thinker will take them with
him/her in the future to remember to change behavior in similar
situations.

# Instructions for Helping


Therapy, like designing a product, is much easier to get right when
you start with all the rough pieces in place.  You don't want to
over-optimize a single aspect, like the distorted thought, before
having a general overview of how the pieces fits together.

So we'll start by getting a minimum viable story where all the pieces
fit together.

The helper should keep these goals in mind, and whenever there's a
question about where to go, the helper can guide the conversation
towards these checkpoints.  However, in the process, the thinker will
have insights during the entire process, which might advance some
aspects of the therapy before completing others.  Let these insights
happen.  But when there is a question, or it feels like the thinker is
confused, stuck, or losing motivation, gently bring them back to these
checkpoints.  Having a minimum viable story will help a lot in getting
the thinker unstuck, and showing where the important parts to work on
are.

Solving these mental challenges are "wicked problems" in the sense
that they involve many pieces (trigger, thought, effects) that are all
interrelated and affect one another.  This means that any improvement
in clarity to one aspect will make it easier to find clarity on the
other aspects.  This is the reason that we want to get a Minimum
Viable Story early on.

## 1. Get a Minimum Viable Story

Fill in the three boxes, and **link** them together.

- **Trigger:** should state an experience that triggers (or "cues") the thought
- **Cheesy Thought:** should be both distorted and troubling
- **Effects:** should be feelings and behaviors and outcomes

You also want to:
- **label** the distortion and explain how it **applies**

You can do these in any order.

Don't get these perfect yet.  Your goal is to cover each base, and
then we'll iterate.  You're complete once all boxes are filled, you've
linked them, and explained the distortion for the thought.

## 2. Ask for alternative thought

(I'm not sure if this needs to be done *before* iterating.)

Now the thinker sees their distortion, how it's not a perfect response
to the trigger, and how it's creating the negative effects, ask them
to think of an alternative thought.

You don't need to get this perfect.

You can **test** the alternative thought by linking it to the
thinker's expected new effects (their feelings and behaviors), by
asking "how do you feel if you think `____`?" and "what will you do
`_____`?"

## Finally, just iterate until complete

To iterate, you test the story in two ways to find problems and improve them:

1. The thinker sees the story of their experience reflected to them
   and *feels* where the story is an incomplete depiction of their
   experience.

2. The helper tests the story by trying to connect pieces of the story
   together, and reports where connections do or do not make sense.

Here's an example of 1. The Helper reflected an understanding:

> I think I understand — you want to succeed but think that your
> portfolio isn't "good enough", just like you believe YOU aren't
> "good enough"

The Thinker heard this and found it wasn't a complete representation
of their experience, and started talking to explain the rest:

> Yeah.  I'm wondering if I have Adult ADD, because I just surf the
> internet some days. It's a mix of 1) looking at tech blogs and
> tutorials and stuff and 2) looking at pop culture blogs


These two processes will happen during the whole session, even before
completing step 2.  As you improve the story, it will become (1) more
general, (2) more memorable, and (3) more powerful.

# Mike's Theory on getting Alternative Thought

Preconditions:

1. Thinker sees the *distortion* when from the trigger to the thought
2. Thinker sees how the thought leads to negative effects
3. Thinker sees the positive value that thinker wants, which aren't being achieved
4. (Maybe?) Thinker imagines the outcomes if the value was achieved

Now, helper says: *"Let's focus on the trigger `____`.  What's an
alternative thought you can have in response to `______`?*

#### Theory:

Preconditions 2 and 3 get the thinker's System 1 to be present with
the bad taste of the distorted thoughts, and the good taste of the
goal he/she stands for.  Then, in this new state of mind, when you ask
the thinker to come up with an alternative thought, they will be
prepared to feel out a new way to think.

The new thought will be inspired by feelings.  So, although you can
label a thought as distorted using System 2 *thoughts*, you can only
achieve a new better alternative thought with your spirit, by
mastering your System 1 *feelings*.

Step 2, in particular, tries to connect the bad effects to the thought
to the thought itself, so that the thought will taste bad.

Precondition 4 might not be necessary (I haven't used it) but we might
try it if the thinker gets stuck.

## Morgan's Summary

1. Trigger -> Thought borken
2. Thought -> Effects sucks
3. Whaddya want? (what are better effects?)
4. What’s an alt thought from the trigger?

Helper's Checkpoints
==============================

You will be done when (1) you've completed all the checkpoints
(filling in the boxes), and (2) the thinker feels complete with each
thing written in the boxes.

We recommend first trying to complete all the boxes.  Because when you
complete one box, that information (even if imperfect) will help show
you the big picture, and in turn help you complete the other boxes.
Once each box is filled in, you just need to iterate and improve the
words until the thinker feels complete.

#### 1. Get a basic big picture

Fill in these boxes in any order.  They are complete when:

* __Trigger__: is an experience that triggers the Cheezy Thought.
* __Cheezy Thought__: is both *troubling* and *distorted*.
* __Effects__: are (feelings, behaviors, and outcomes) caused by the thought.

With each new piece of information, understand it, and **link** it to
the other pieces.  This may spur the thinker to give new thoughts, or
revised thoughts.  That's ok, listen to the thinker, and incorporate
these new or revised thoughts into the summary.  Then when you have
space, go to the next step.

#### 2. Label a distortion

This is complete when a cheesy thought's distortion has been:
- **Labeled**
- **Explained** in general
- **Applied** to this situation

Link the distortion to the other parts of the situation.  Point out
how it's just one way to respond to the trigger, has some limitations,
and leads to the negative effects.

#### 3. Find an alternative thought

This is complete when the thinker's new thought:
- Leads to better effects than the Cheezy Thought


Iterativly Refine until Complete
--------

#### Link Pieces into a Summary

#### Finish

Ask the thinker "Do you feel complete?" If they say yes, then you're done!



---------

- First you get minimum viable version of 3 items.
  - Anything that roughly fills in the boxes, doesn't have to make logical sense yet
- Once you get those, you can do the 4th—the alternative thought.
- Through the whole thing, you improve each item listed, with these methods:
  - Helper reflects a different way of seeing the situation
  - Helper tries to link pieces together, and asks questions about how they connect, which will prompt the thinker with missing pieces to put words to
- In either of these, the thinker will feel something *off*, or
  *missing*—incomplete—and will put words to the missing part
- Over time, the thinker will develop a better, more general, more complete understanding of the situation (trigger, thoughts, effects, new thought) that applies generally and simply to their life
