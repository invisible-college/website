# Stress and Hierarchies of Thought Efficacy

There are lots of hierarchies of efficacy.  If we fail at a higher
level, we fall back to a lower level:

## Stress

We often get stuck at the lower levels.  People in therapy are often
stuck with bad thoughts freaking out about issues at the bottom.
Bitcoin dialogues get stuck.  We get into situations where everyone is
fighting and then they attack at lower levels, and then have to defend
at lower levels.

We can fail at a higher level (e.g. finding the central point in order
to refute it) because we are stressed.  It's hard to listen
empathetically and really hear the other party's high level point when
stressed.  Then in that stress, we will want to make an action, so
we'll take a shortcut action â€” a lower-level response.  This low-level
response is likely to cause the other party stress.  This stress, in
turn, can make them less likely to listen and refute a central point.
It takes a lot of work and energy to find meaning and progress.

We need to find more space and clear thought to make progress in
thinking and find the higher level thoughts.

## And this is just kinda funny. :)
It's the hierarchy of mommy:
