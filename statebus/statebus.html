<abstract>
    Anyone can add a website to the open web, but individual websites
    are closed.  <!--Only Facebook employees can contribute to
    Facebook, for example.--> And the economics of the web have led to
    a number of large near-monopoly websites, such as Facebook and
    Google.  To compete with these monopolies, we need open websites
    that anyone can contribute to.  We can build open websites with a
    new web architecture that defines a standard protocol for
    the <i>insides</i> of websites.  This architecture,
    called <conc>Statebus</conc>, both makes it easier to develop the
    internals of a website, while simultaneously making it easy to
    share the internals with other websites.

    linking to other pages.  However, it provides

    Dynamic web applications can be much easier to program if we
    automate the synchronization of state amongst their components
    (DOM, models, REST endpoints, server caches,
    databases, <i>etc.</i>).  We can automate this synchronization
    with a standard protocol, that we call <conc>Statebus</conc>,
    which improves upon <conc>REST</conc> to keep
    state <i>synchronized</i>—not just transferred—amongst multiple
    components.  Using this protocolor makes dynamic websites much
    easier to program, while at the same time enabling other programs
    and websites to build upon their state.

<i>Caption:</i>
<ol>
  <li>Before the web, people could connect to monolith networks like
  Aol, Compuserve and Prodigy.  Each had a proprietary protocol.  To
  contribute to the monolith, you needed special permission.
  Monoliths did not link to one another.

  <li>On the web, every page has a URL, and can link to any other
  page.  Websites add value to one another by linking to each other.
  But they can only link to <i>pages</i>: the presentation of the
  underlying data in a database; the surface of the websites.

  <li>Statebus opens the <i>insides</i> of websites.  Each piece of
  state has a URL.  A website's state can derive from other websites.

<h2>The Web is Incomplete</h2>

<h2>Architecture of Reactive State</h2>

<!--
<p><i>State Communications:</i>

We have these <i>State Boundaries</i>.  Across them, we need special
synchronization abilities.  Change methods.

<p>(Examples: Server. Client. DOM vs. JS Models.  Each JS Model
vs. others.  Database vs. activerecord.  Anything OOP with
<i>encapsulated</i> state.)

<p>State can change in lots of ways.  But you shouldn't pass that
knowledge through the whole system.  You don't want every component to
have to know all the ways the state might change, and have an update
mechanism.

<p>When you re-render from scratch, you only have to specify one
way to draw it, instead of many ways to change it.


<h3>Programming API</h3>

Reactive functions are registered on callbacks, so that whenever state
changes, the function is re-run.

<h3>Network Protocol</h3>

We support this with a few changes to REST, that
supports <i>synchronization</i> and not just <i>transfer</i>.
