      <h1>Statebus</h1>

<abstract>

    Every web <i>page</i> has an openly accessible <conc>URL</conc>,
    but the state <i>within</i> pages are
    proprietary.  <conc>Statebus</conc> allows ______ __ _______ by
    extending <conc>HTTP</conc> in three ways.  First, it gives each
    piece of internal state a <conc>URL.</conc> Second, it allows any
    state to depend upon any other state.  Third, it provides a
    guarantee that all fetched state will automatically update when
    its dependencies change.  This makes it easier to develop
    websites, and encourages sharing state across websites and other
    computers.

</abstract>

  <conc>Statebus</conc> makes three extensions to <conc>HTTP</conc>:
  <ol>
    <li>Each piece of <i>state</i> has a <conc>URL</conc>, not just each <i>page</i> (or file).
    <li>A piece of state can <i>depend</i> on other pieces of state, with <i>links</i> to their <conc>URL</conc>s
    <li>Each state is automatically promised to be <i>updated</i> when it or its dependencies change
  </ol>

  These three changes let you construct websites out of many layers of
  state that are interdependent, and all update together,
  automatically, even across other websites, over the network, or
  anywhere, as long as they obey the <conc>statebus</conc> protocol.

  <p>And we can build a whole website as a set of reactive
  layers.  <i>Using</i> the web protocol, rather
  than <i>implementing</i> the web protocol on the outside with a
  bunch of proprietary gunk on the inside.

  <p><img src="images/stack3.svg" width="700">

  <p>Each of these black circles is a piece of state.  For instance,
  each <i>controller</i> in Rails returns a piece of <conc>JSON</conc>
  state, which depends on the state of a <i>model</i>, which depends
  on the state of the database.  In Rails, you'd use a different API
  for a controller than you would for a model.  But with statebus,
  each piece of state has a uniform interface; each
  has <conc>URL</conc>, and each depends on the state below, linked
  with black lines in the diagram.

  <h2>Examples</h2>
    
  <p>Let's start at the top of the stack, and make a page that renders
  from state.  We've written a handy single-file programming system,
  because statebus lets you decouple nodes of state.  Here we have
  implemented a whole blog web app within a single <conc>html</conc>
  file, decoupled from a server.

  <pre class="codeblock">&lt;script type="statebus"&gt;

dom.BODY = ->
  blog = fetch('state://stateb.us/&lt;yourname&gt;/blog')
  DIV
    for post in blog.posts
      DIV
        H1 post.title
        DIV post.body

#&lt;/script>&lt;script src="https://stateb.us/client.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

  <p><conc>Statebus</conc> is backwards-compatible
  with <conc>HTTP</conc>, and we have implemented a number of wrappers
  to make compatibility consistent.  The first and last lines are a
  wrapper that lets you implement a whole statebus web app within a
  single <conc>html</conc> file, decoupled from a server.

  <p>If you put this into a <code>.html</code> file on your laptop,
  and then double-click it to open in a web browser (you'll see
  a <code>file:///</code> <conc>URL</conc>), you'll see a
  working <conc>statebus</conc> blog, in a single <conc>html</conc>
  file!

  <p>It'll be empty until you add some content though.  Open your
  browser's <conc>console</conc> and run:

<pre class="codeblock">
save({
  key: 'state://stateb.us/&lt;yourname&gt;/blog',
  posts: [{title: 'hello', body: 'world'}]
})
</pre>

  <p>Notice how the app automatically updated as soon as you ran that
  line?  And reload the page, now you'll see it persists.  That state
  is saved to the
  <conc>URL</conc> <code>state://stateb.us/&lt;yourname&gt;/blog</code>,
  and will persist as you reload.  And if there are other people
  saving that state, you'll all share the same state since you share
  that <conc>URL</conc>, and see each change to same state together
  simultaneously.


  <h2>Diff/Patch API</h2>

  <p>The differential synchronization <conc>API</conc> can be just a simple extension to the
  current <conc>API</conc>. You can register a normal reactive
  function like you do now, which won't receive diffs. It'll receive
  the new state.

  <p>To receive diffs, we'll make a new <conc>API</conc> that lets you
    register handlers for each type of diff event:

    <pre class="codeblock">hash.change(from, to)
array.change(start, end, replace_with)
string.change(start, end, replace_with)</pre>

  <P>We could also add <conc>move</conc> operations.

  <p>If there is a handler registered for diff operations on a piece
  of state, then statebus will automatically know to hold onto a
  shadow copy of that state, and diff it every time there's an update
  in order to send out the patch operations to the registered handler.
