<h1>Statebus</h1>

<abstract>
    Anyone can add a website to the open web, but individual websites
    are closed.  <!--Only Facebook employees can contribute to
    Facebook, for example.--> And the economics of the web have led to
    a number of large near-monopoly websites, such as Facebook and
    Google.  To compete with these monopolies, we need open websites
    that anyone can contribute to.  We can build open websites with a
    new web architecture that defines a standard protocol for
    the <i>insides</i> of websites.  This architecture,
    called <conc>Statebus</conc>, both makes it easier to develop the
    internals of a website, while simultaneously making it easy to
    share the internals with other websites.

    Dynamic web applications can be much easier to program if we
    automate the synchronization of state amongst their components
    (DOM, models, REST endpoints, server caches,
    databases, <i>etc.</i>).  We can automate this synchronization
    with a standard protocol, that we call <conc>Statebus</conc>,
    which improves upon <conc>REST</conc> to keep
    state <i>synchronized</i>—not just transferred—amongst multiple
    components.  Using this protocolor makes dynamic websites much
    easier to program, while at the same time enabling other programs
    and websites to build upon their state.
</abstract>

<h2>Much of programming is just moving state around</h2>

<p>We take it from a database, repackage it into "models", put those into
"controllers", these controllers rewrap it as JSON, send it over the
wire via something like XMLHTTPRequest to a web browser, which stores
it in another set of "models" in JavaScript, whose data is then
plugged into HTML templates, and finally rendered into the DOM.

<p><img src="stack1.svg" width="550">

<p>We do this wrangling by connecting many different systems, with different APIs to learn:

  <ul><li>React<li>Backbone<li>Ember<li>Angular<li>Handlebars
    <li>Flux<li>GraphQL
    <li>Relay<li>Falcor<li>Websockets<li>XMLHTTPrequest
    <li>ActiveController<li>ActiveRecord</ul>

<h3>Synchronizing is hard</h3>
<p>It becomes difficult to keep these synchronized when something
changes.  If a circle's state depends on another circle's state, then
it must know to update whenever the other one updates.  If you don't
have a perfect system, this can get complex.

<p>These circles often communicate with <i>events</i>,
like <tt>messageAdded</tt> rather than state.  This makes it more
complex because ______.  And it breaks caching because a cache will
need to know each event.


<h3>One-way re-rendering solves synchronization</h3>
<p>React points out that we can simplify the synchronization of DOM
with Javascript Models by re-rendering the DOM each time the
Javascript changes.  But it doesn't address all the other levels of
state.

<p>Statebus generalizes this idea to the whole stack, on client and
server.  Each level is re-rendered from the circles it depends on.  To
make it efficient:

<ul>
  <li>Scopes: Only re-render the nodes depending on changed state
  <li>Diffs: For the layers that are the most expensive (DOM and network) or
  involve other state outside of our control (cursor and scroll
  positions in the DOM), a diff is computed, and applied as a patch

</ul>

<p>We can apply this general technique to each layer, replacing this
ad-hoc soup with a uniform, efficient, simple architecture that
requires less code, incurs less complexity, and provides more
features.

<h2>Statebus unifies state management</h2>

<p>We can simplify all these technologies into two operations
happening: (1) Fetching state, and (2) Saving changes to state.

<p>Statebus lets you implement each layer uniformly, with just these
two methods <conc>fetch()</conc> and <conc>save()</conc>.

<p><img src="stack2.svg" width="550">

<p>You can write the same functionality with much less code.  [Show examples]

<h3>Reactive updates</h3>

<p>This is what makes code so much simpler.  One-way dataflow, single
source of truth, etc.  This is the best FRP ever made.

<h2>And enables new architectures</h2>

Because you have the same protocol throughout the stack, you can now
flexibly remove one part and replace it with another.

<h3>Single file apps</h3>

<p>For instance, we can replace the server with a dumb store that
doesn't have any code of its own.

<p><img src="singlefile.svg" width="550">

<h3>Mashups & remixes</h3>

<p><img src="otherservice.svg" width="550">

<p><tt>other_data = fetch('state://other.service/something1')</tt>

<p>Because nodes have a uniform protocol, incorporating data from a
different site is as easy as giving it a different
URL.

<h3>Microservices</h3>

<p>(Make diagram that replaces server side with multiple services of
different colors.)</p>

<h3>Offline mode</h3>

<h3>Dashboards</h3>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>
<p>(Make diagram)</p>

<h2>This leads to a new web</h2>

<p>These methods <conc>fetch</conc> and <conc>save</conc> are more
powerful versions of HTTP's <conc>GET</conc> and <conc>PUT</conc>.
They give us features necessary to author the <i>insides</i> of
websites with a shared protocol.

<i>Caption:</i>
<ol>
  <li>Before the web, people could connect to monolith networks like
  Aol, Compuserve and Prodigy.  Each had a proprietary protocol.  To
  contribute to the monolith, you needed special permission.
  Monoliths did not link to one another.

  <li>On the web, every page has a URL, and can link to any other
  page.  Websites add value to one another by linking to each other.
  But they can only link to <i>pages</i>: the presentation of the
  underlying data in a database; the surface of the websites.

  <li>Statebus opens the <i>insides</i> of websites.  Each piece of
  state has a URL.  A website's state can derive from other websites.

</ol>

<h1>Blech</h1>


<h2>The Web is Incomplete</h2>

<h2>Beyond REST: Architecture of Reactive State</h2>

<ul><li>Resources are composed of others via links</li>
   <ul><li>A standard "key" attribute on JSON</li></ul>

   <li>Server promises to push all updates to fetched state
   <ul><li>Allows caching
     <li>Needs a new push mechanism</ul>
</ul>


<h3>Variation on REST methods</h3>
<ul>

  <li><conc>Fetch</conc>: Like <conc>GET</conc>, but with a little
  intelligence.  It might recurse with multiple <conc>Fetch</conc>es
  itself to compose the resource, and then it promises to update the
  caller whenever the resource changes.

  <li><conc>Save</conc>: Like <conc>PUT</conc>, but also triggers
  updates to all subscribers of the resource.

  <li><conc>Forget</conc>: A new method that a client issues when it's
  done listening to a resource, and doesn't need to be notified
  anymore.
</ul>

<!--
<p><i>State Communications:</i>

We have these <i>State Boundaries</i>.  Across them, we need special
synchronization abilities.  Change methods.

<p>(Examples: Server. Client. DOM vs. JS Models.  Each JS Model
vs. others.  Database vs. activerecord.  Anything OOP with
<i>encapsulated</i> state.)

<p>State can change in lots of ways.  But you shouldn't pass that
knowledge through the whole system.  You don't want every component to
have to know all the ways the state might change, and have an update
mechanism.

<p>When you re-render from scratch, you only have to specify one
way to draw it, instead of many ways to change it.


<h3>Programming API</h3>

Reactive functions are registered on callbacks, so that whenever state
changes, the function is re-run.

<h3>Network Protocol</h3>

We support this with a few changes to REST, that
supports <i>synchronization</i> and not just <i>transfer</i>.
