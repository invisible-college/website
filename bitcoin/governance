New Notes 2-16-2016
===================

**Abstract:** Bitcoin needs to be able to make decisions better.  We
don't agree to a single process.  When people breach others'
expectations, they get upset, and fight and low levels, which slows
progress and disincentivizes development talent.

We will succeed when
 - Developers find it enjoyable to work
 - Their work goes a long way

Right now it's hard for developers to know if their changes will be accepted.

One of bitcoin's biggest threats is ourselves.
[cite [jim harper's report](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf)
fearing that a rift amongst developers would slow software development
and lead to a hard fork.]

**Abstract 2:**

Bitcoin has a natural hierarchy of powers:
 - **Development.** Have the power to write code.  The developers come
    up with ideas, and want to make decisions together.  There are
    multiple development teams.  They have the power to implement with
    a release.  So the team has a concentration of power within the
    developer category.
 - **Mining.** But if they don't, the miners have to adjudicate.
   There are multiple miners, and mining pools, and miners can move
   their hashpower amongst the pools.
 - **Trading.** If the miners make a bad decision, then the traders
   will adjudicate, and choose an alternative coin.  Traders will need
   an exchange to support the coin, so exchanges also have power,
   similar to the power of pools.
   - **Use?** Users are a subset of traders who, aquire some
     currency for the purpose of actually using it.  However, they are
     still traders.  They trade something to get the currency, and
     then trade the currency for a good or server.

This much isn't up for debate.  But we need to decide on how we will
all work together, given these hard powers.

Right now, these groups make decisions independently.  Bitcoin-Core
has its own consensus process, and people get upset if you go outside
of that process.

**[example of adam back crying about consensus]**
**[example of people saying that the "technical experts" in the developer
community are against a change]**

The miners make decisions for themselves, since they are independent
operations, but recently have started talking more and more, both
amongst one another, and amongst the developers.  They are innovators
on their own individual operations, which they do independently
because they are competing, but they also talk now that they are being
asked to vote on consensus on protocol decisions.

Traders watch everything happening and make judgement calls on which
coins are gaining or losing value.  They talk on forums, often in
small groups, but speak with their trades.

**We don't need to change this natural order.  Our goal is to make
  communication more efficient.** One problem is that some parties
  don't see the legitimacy of others forces.  For example, developers
  have said that a hard fork is being forced upon them without
  consensus; however, on the contrary, mining pressure actually
  creates consensus.  And miners have said that they want developers
  to decide, even though they hold the power to vote by choosing which
  fork to add their hashpower to—they are not accepting the power of
  their hash.  Third, many do not accept the legitimacy of forking
  code to make a change.  [cite maxwell, and others]

Most of the action in protocol development happens at the top level,
amongst the developers.  This is where we should focus our governance
efforts.  Developers are free to write code for whatever purpose they
want, but I am most interested in implementations that seek to
maximize security and value.  I will here lay out a governance model
for clients that want this.

Developers will probably want to maximize for security, because that
increases value.  And they will also want to maximize for use, because
they want to see their ideas become realized.

If you want to maximize security and value, then you want to optimize for 

### The problem: Without an agreement on how to make decisions, we fall back to hard force, which is slow and painful.

There's a consensus model in bitcoin-dev.  That wasn't enough, and we
fell back onto hashpower voting.  People perceive this as a "hostile"
fork, an act of "force".  A contentious hard-fork being forced upon
them.

But the other side sees no way forward.

When a process breaks down, people descend to [lower levels of
disagreement](http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html).

![Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg/500px-Graham's_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg.png)

We see examples of this in:
- 1.
- 2.
- 3.

This drives away developers, who see the environment as "hostile":
- [Mike hearn's post about hostile bitcoin-dev, and then him going away]

### Slow and painful

These lower levels are slow, because they are indirect.  This makes
bitcoin adapt more slowly, which makes it less able to compete.

And they are painful, which 

## The solution

When people get frustrated at a higher level, they descend to a lower
level, because they see possibility there.  However, we don't want
people to descend to name-calling.  We'd rather they descend to
addressing miners or traders.

The traders, for instance, should have discussion boards on what they
want and what they will vote on.  If blocks go to 2MB, they should
argue that all of bitcoin will be more valuable, and then convince one
another, and back this up with their votes.

The miners need an open channel of communication with devs, because
they need to be talking directly with them.  And devs also need an
open channel with traders.  Traders will be making bets on how the
price will change, depending on the value of coinbase, etc.  Coinbase
adds value to the economy, but some devs think coinbase is evil,
e.g. because it's "a bank, not a wallet."


Crowd Defines the Groups 2-17-2016
====================

The main issue at hand is how to do protocol forks/upgrades.  We only
want to try to fork once we've got the network's consensus.

### The problem has been that nobody can define consensus.  People cry foul when there's forking without consensus, but there's no way to determine consensus without a fork.

I've been trying to define consensus in 3 clean groups:
- devs
- miners
- traders

...but in reality, miners are also traders.  And wallet makers I guess
are devs... but there are also business people, and there are
regulators, and all of those people's opinions might matter, and we
can't define all the people who matter up front.

A more general approach is for the community to define what matters,
making its own groups (e.g. "wallets"), and then other people can cite
them and reference them.

This way, each client code can define the constituencies that they
believe matter, citing the groups that they think are well-defined.
Then you can trust a client, and the client can trust a group... which
trusts the opinion of people...

Also, right now we don't have critical mass of developer talent.
There aren't enough people working on the code.  It's kind of amazing
that we have so much value held in bitcoin with such shallow code.


The bitcoin governance process
===========================

We need to get people to agree to a process for making protocol
decisions.  Debate would be more productive with an agreed process.

A bunch of the problem was different people having different ideas of
what the process was.  Adam Back was saying that we need consensus,
amongst developers on the mailing list, but Satoshi stated the process
differently when he said that miners can decide the rules by voting
with their hashpower.  Then when people went with a fork, to vote with
hashpower, Adam screamed fowl play, and got very upset.

When people think others are breaking the rules, they break the rules
back.  So then we had DDOS attacks.  And personal attacks, and
character assassinations, and other gross punches below the belt,
because there was no agreement on where the belt was.

Theymos had his own ideas for process, which involved using moderation
rules to enforce a single consensus process on a single forum.
Unfortunately, most of us thought that censorship should not be a part
of the process of debate.


Requirements for the process design
-----------------------------------

### Clear decision points

Gavin wants:
- Clear decision points
- Clear ways to make decisions

Gavin wants a way to rein in discussions so that they don't go on
forever.  He notes that each IETF working group has a chair, who can
decide that there has been enough debate on an issue, and there is now
consensus in direction X or Y.

However, that introduces central control in the decision of of when
consensus has been reached.  That person might postpone declaring
consensus, if he or a powerful minority doesn't like the consensus.
For instance, Wlad could take that role in Core but he has not
declared that there is consensus.  Our considerit approach, instead,
is to let the crowd weigh in on a decision, and if a whole lot of
people weigh in, then it's not very likely to change.  In addition, we
can put up statistics saying the likelihood of a decision changing
after N people have weighed in.

Each project group can have a deadline for when they release features.
These releases should be time-based.  And anything that's good enough
at the feature-freeze point should be included in the release.

### Reflects natural powers

The VOTE: (let's debate this) Nature wants votes going to those who hold power:
- Hashpower votes
- Price goes up (can use markets to judge, and miners can judge)


### Decisions made by people with the information

We also want each decision to be made by the people with the right
information for making it.  Communism failed partially because people
lacked incentives, but from Herb Simon's perspective because the
information wasn't in the hands of the right people.  You can see a
similar problem in bitcoin—the developers don't talk with the miners
and users.  Then they have to make a decision on the blocksize limit
but don't know what's best.  They don't want to make a bad decision.
The miners don't want to make a bad decision on the protocol either,
and they don't have expertise for all aspects of it.  They want to be
able to trust somebody.  Gavin wants to know who somebody is before he
listens to them.

We could address these by filtering votes to the people with expertise
on topics, and also by punishing people for giving naïve opinions.
One way to punish them is to see if they are saying things that are
wrong, like a pro/con point that the crowd points out is incorrect.
You can also weight up people's opinions that give pro/cons that stand
up to the crowd's votes.

#### Getting the right information

We could also try to incentivize research to get information, like
Jonathan did with testnet experiments.

Getting agreement on the process
--------------------------------

We can have people vote on considerit how they want the process to
work.  This can end with a vote to use our process.

We can pursuade people to use this process.

- Persuade software repos to use it
- Persuade miners to use it
- Persuade businesses to use it
- Persuade users to use it

We should propose our process as a BIP, and also make it a considerit
proposal.

Maybe we should include all BIPs as considerit proposals too.


The Powers Beneath
=================

### Miners

Miners provide the security of the network, and are an immense display
of strength.  They will be conservative, since they are miners, and
their job is to pursue short-term profits.

They want the Bitcoin price to rise, because they make money in
Bitcoins from investments made in the past.  THe price of Bitcoin has
a larger effect on their profits than most other factors.  But they
also want high transaction fees, and things like efficiency (so that
they can easily integrate bitcoin systems).

But the the Bitcoin price is important, and it will be difficult for
them alone to predict whether a change to the protocol will cause the
price to increase or decrease.  So they will want strong signals of
economic support, like you might get from a prediction market.

A design
--------

- Immediate dev decisions care what miners will adopt.  These opinions can be on considerit.
- Miners might look at the prediction market to see what users want



From individuals, to weights, to groups
=====================

- Jonathan should be able to weight his own people.  Then he'll build
  toward those people.
- Then other people can weight their people.
- Then people can create groups of people, and view the weights of all
  group memebrs composed together
  - You can see all miners' opinions
  - And then see the weighted opinions of the people the miners respect
  - You can view Bitcoin Classic developers

The view from above
---------------------

We want to have a "classic devs opinions" view, and "miner's opinions"
and "core devs opinions" and "silicon valley's opinions" views.  And
wallets, and exchanges.  That way you can see what the different
groups think.

There can be multiple versions of each group, and they can be "vouched
for" by people.  You can read that person's version of the group to
see how they think the weights fall.  You can choose the one with the
most people vouching for it... or you can choose a different one if
you prefer.

A group is: **A set of weights on people**

Whenever a user rates people, he does so w.r.t. a group tag.  You can
see a particular user's group ratings, or the average group ratings
for a group tag, or make a meta-group, composed of weights on other
peoples' group weights.

**Classic would do:**
- Set up a weighted list of miners by hashpower and host on aws
- Make a list of classic people and average their weights on voters to
  make the group for non-miners classic votes
